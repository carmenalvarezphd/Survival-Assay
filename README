#The effects of Host-Pathogen Evolutionary Relationships on Trait-Variation in Host Mortality 

This repository contains code used to analyze survival assays examining how *C. elegans* populations respond to co-evolved vs. ancestral pathogen exposure from a virulent vs. hypervirulent strain. 
Analysis focuses on mortality in population to estimate trait variation in populations under various conditions.

## Experiment Overview 
Populations of C. elegans evolved for 20 generations under three treatments: (1) co-evolving with live S. marcescens, (2) evolving with ancestral S. marcescens, and (3) evolving with heat-killed S. marcescens as a control. 
Each treatment was conducted in four independent evolutionary replicates. From each replicate, five worms were selected and inbred for six generations to generate homogenous populations, each representing a distinct phenotype. 
To quantify pathogen susceptibility, a population of worms from each inbreeding lineage was exposed to ancestral S. marcescens strains and population level mortality was quantified and compared across conditions.

## Analysis Overview 
- data imported and cleaned using *tidyverse*
- population variation in survival modeled by calculating pairwise distances in the dataset and comparing within vs. between group differences at different nested groupings 
- statistical comparison using a zero-inflated beta regression using *gamlss*
- visualization of pairwise differences between groups using *ggplot2* and *patchwork*

## Output Plots 
Representative output plots show pairwise differences within and between groups when populations were exposed to fixed pathogen evolution vs. co-evolving pathogen
