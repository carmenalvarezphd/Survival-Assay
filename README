#The effects of Host-Pathogen Evolutionary Relationships on Trait-Variation in Host Mortality 

This repository contains code used to analyze survival assays examining how *C. elegans* populations respond to co-evolved vs. ancestral pathogen exposure from a virulent vs. hypervirulent strain. Analysis focuses on mortality in population to estimate trait variation in populations under various conditions. 

## Contents 
-**README**- project overview (this file)
-**ExampleData-SurvivalAnalysis**- an empty excel sheet that explains data structure and variables 
-**SurvivalAssayVariationAnalysis**- R markdown document for data cleaning, analysis and visualization 
-**Figures**- Summary Figures; final output plots 

## Analysis Overview 
- data imported and cleaned using *tidyverse*
- population variation in survival modeled by calculating pairwise distances in the dataset and comparing within vs. between group differences at different nested groupings 
- statistical comparison using a zero-inflated beta regression using *gamlss*
- visualization of pairwise differences between groups using *ggplot2*

## Output Plots 
Representative output plots show pairwise differences within and between groups when populations were exposed to fixed pathogen evolution vs. co-evolving pathogen
